## Code / Workflow Standards

- **No real credentials** — all env vars must use placeholder values (e.g. `YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`)
- **Mermaid diagrams** — architecture diagrams should be in Mermaid format for native GitHub rendering
- **README sections** — project READMEs should follow the template in `templates/workflow-readme-template.md`
- **Workflow JSON files** — if adding n8n/Make exports, sanitize all credentials before committing
